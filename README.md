# 🛸 FinAI: Agentic Loanflow Prototype

**FinAI** is a high-fidelity, multi-agent conversational AI system designed to automate the end-to-end loan application lifecycle. It features a specialized **Master Orchestrator** that manages state transitions across four distinct AI agents, wrapped in a "Classy Sci-Fi" terminal interface.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Linear state-machine handoffs between Sales, KYC, Underwriting, and Document agents.
* **Sci-Fi UI/UX:** A React-based terminal featuring a Matrix-style binary background (Canvas API) and neon-green glow effects.
* **Mock Verification Services:** Simulated API integrations for PAN/Aadhaar identity checks and credit scoring.
* **Dynamic Document Generation:** Automated production of a digital Sanction Letter (Mock PDF) upon approval.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The core of FinAI is a **Linear Workflow Agentic Design**. Each agent is responsible for a specific state in the lifecycle:

| Agent | State | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sales (Humanizer)** | `SALES` | Rapport building and initial requirement gathering. |
| **Verification (KYC)** | `KYC_REQUIRED` | Identity validation using mock PAN/Aadhaar data. |
| **Underwriting** | `UNDERWRITING` | Risk assessment via mock credit score and income-to-debt rules. |
| **Document Agent** | `DECISION_READY` | Final letter generation and storage handling. |

## 📊 Underwriting Logic (The "Brain")

The system calculates loan eligibility using specific financial guardrails:

### Approval Conditions
* $\text{Credit Score} \ge 650$
* $\text{Annual Income} \ge 40,000$

### Sanction Calculation
$$\text{Max Approved} = \min(\text{Requested Amount}, \text{Annual Income} \times 4.5)$$

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Pydantic (Schema Validation), Uvicorn.
* **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5 Canvas (Binary Animation), CSS Modules (Sci-Fi Theme).
* **Agents:** Custom state-machine logic with LLM-ready prompts.
* **Services:** Mock API simulation for Credit and PDF generation.
